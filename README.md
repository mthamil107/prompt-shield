# prompt-shield
Self-learning prompt injection detection engine that gets smarter with every attack — 21 built-in detectors, vector similarity vault, community threat intelligence, and 3-gate protection for agentic AI applications
It is a production-grade Python library that detects and blocks prompt injection attacks targeting LLM-powered applications. Unlike static detection tools, it gets smarter over time — every blocked attack strengthens its vector similarity vault, community users collectively harden defenses through shared threat intelligence, and false positive feedback automatically tunes detection sensitivity. It provides 3-gate protection for agentic architectures: scanning user inputs, tool results from MCP and function calls, and LLM outputs for prompt leakage.
