# Prompt Shield - Dify Plugin

A Dify tool plugin that provides local prompt injection detection and PII redaction powered by [prompt-shield](https://github.com/mthamil107/prompt-shield).

## Tools

### Prompt Injection Scan (`scan`)

Scans text for prompt injection attacks using multiple detection strategies. Returns a risk score (0.0-1.0), a recommended action (`pass`, `log`, `flag`, or `block`), and details about detected threats.

### PII Scan (`pii_scan`)

Detects personally identifiable information in text, including email addresses, phone numbers, SSNs, credit card numbers, IP addresses, and more. Returns entity types and counts without modifying the text.

### PII Redact (`pii_redact`)

Redacts PII from text by replacing sensitive data with entity-type-aware placeholders (e.g., `[EMAIL_REDACTED]`, `[PHONE_REDACTED]`). Returns the redacted text along with counts of what was redacted.

### Output Scan (`output_scan`)

Scans LLM output for harmful content including toxicity, code injection, system prompt leakage, PII exposure, and jailbreak persona adoption. Returns whether the output was flagged, along with details about each flag raised.

## Installation

1. Ensure `prompt-shield-ai` is installed in your Dify plugin runtime environment:

   ```

2. Package and install the plugin into your Dify instance following the [Dify plugin development guide](https://docs.dify.ai/plugins/develop-plugins/tool-plugin).

## Configuration
